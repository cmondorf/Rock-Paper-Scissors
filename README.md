# Rock-Paper-Scissors

Implementation of the [Rock-Paper-Scissors](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/1956/view) project from IPND.

Currently only the classical version of the game is playable, though code is commented out that can be
used to play Spock.

Remaining TODOs:

* Add color to the output.
* Create a tournament mode with all player styles playing all others. Rank them.
* It turns out there is an [optimal strategy](https://arstechnica.com/science/2014/05/win-at-rock-paper-scissors-by-knowing-thy-opponent/) to play RPS. Would be nice to implement this someday.
